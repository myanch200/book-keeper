# Handy script to run rails credentials:edit with EDITOR exported.
# I find it super handy so I've included it (you might not need it).

# Set the EDITOR environment variable
export EDITOR="code --wait"

# Run rails credentials:edit ($@ passes through additional arguments to the command)
bin/rails credentials:edit $@
